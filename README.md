Contains 4 files

1) VAE architecture: implementation of variational autoencoder (VAE) code with graph convolution layers

2) Feature extraction: analysis of the VAE latent features code

3) Latent space: turn VAE embeddings into a latent space graph

4) Classifier: Ensemble of K-Nearest-Neighbors and Logistic Regression classifiers on VAE embeddings code
